ABOUT DATASET:- 
150 rows, 50 each for 3 unique species.
5 columns:- 1) sepal_length 2)sepal_width 3)petal_length 4)petal_width 5)species

sepal length (max - min) = 3.6
sepal width (max - min) = 2.4
petal length (max - min) =5.9
petal width  (max - min) =2.4


3 unique species of iris
1) setosa
2) versicolor
3) virginica

=> linear relation between petal length and width

=>week linear relation between sepal length and petal width

=>evenly distributed dataset with equal no. of entries of each species i.e., 50 

=>for setosa:-
         60% of data is greater than or equal 50 quantile


=> setosa:- petal length range between 0-2 and width 0-0.6
            majority of sepal width is between 3 - 4.2
            sepal length 4.2-5.9

=>versicolor:- 
              petal length 3-5.2
              petal width 1-1.8
              sepal length 4.8 - 7
              sepal width 2-4

=>virginica:- 
              petal length 4.5 - 7
              petal width 1.4-2.5
              sepal length 4.8 - 8
              sepal width 2.1 - 3.8



=>Size from smallest to largest:- setosa<versicolor<virginica



=>setosa to virginica:-
          mean percentage = sepal length is 75.98% of virginica
          sepal width is 114.92 % of virginica ( this implies that setosa have shorter length and are bigger in width)
          petal length is 26.36% of virginical and petal width is 12.04% of virginical
          (this implies that setosa  are exiguous than virginica)



=>setosa to versicolor:-
          sepal length 84.330% of versicolor
          sepal width 123.39% of versicolor
          petal length 34.66% of versicolor
          petal width 18.40% of versicolor
          (this implies that mean ratio of sepal length of setosa is 15.66% less than that of versicolor, while width is 23.39% more, 
          yet petal length and width are drastically small than that of versicolor, i.e., 65.34 and 381.60% respectively)

=>virginica to versicolor:-
          sepal length 110.98% of versicolor
          sepal width 107.3% of versicolor
          petal length 130.32% of versicolor
          petal width 152.79% of versicolor
          (this implies that sepal length and width of virginica is close to versicolor but mean length and width is greater than versicolor by 10.98% and 7.3% respectively, 
          moreover, petal length and width of virginica is 30.32% and 52.79% bigger than versicolor)
